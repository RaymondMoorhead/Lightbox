# Lightbox

A C++ OpenGL demo project, featuring Blinn-Phong shading and Shadow Mapping using loaded GLTF models.

The code has written and tested on Ubuntu 20.04, but with the apporpiate libraries should run on most machines. Compilation is done with g++. 

Loading is performed by [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad), context creation and input are done with [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), and debug windows are created with [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).
